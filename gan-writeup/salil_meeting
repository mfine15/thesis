- The query class is the only thing that imposes the underlying metric space structure
    - Not necessarily a meaningful distance relation between datapoints otherwise
- This final wasserstein 


- Explain how the GAN literature got to the formulation of one lipschitz wasserstein distance
- but its not clear that that's actually the most relevant constraint for our query class
- ultimate goal: find a way of constraining discriminators that makes gan objective easy to train while still looking a lot like the query class
