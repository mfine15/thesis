* Differentially private time series data
* Local-DP Dualquery
* Generate a synthetic dataset that tells you the accuracy of a query run on another synthetic dataset
  * Alternatively, investigate whether you get better results generating 2 (or n) synthetic datasets and aggregating (wait is this just PATE)
* Exponential mechanism local model
* ML approximation of exponential mechansim
* Is mode collapse a problem with privGAn?



* Correlated queries (matrix mechanism) for gans/machine learning
* Differentially private time series generation with gans
* 





* Allow you to weight the class of queries — constrained discriminator
* See how often GAN solutions preserve three way marginals
* Compare gan convergence perf etc
* Mode collapse — https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-why-it-is-so-hard-to-train-generative-advisory-networks-819a86b3750b
* What's the max divergence (KL or otherwise) of two distributions with the same three-way (or two-way) marginals
* Use momemnt matchng (Goodfellow p. 694) instead of GANS
