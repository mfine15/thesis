  abstract = {The widespread acceptance of differential privacy has led to the publication of many sophisticated algorithms for protecting privacy. However, due to the subtle nature of this privacy definition, many such algorithms have bugs that make them violate their claimed privacy. In this paper, we consider the problem of producing counterexamples for such incorrect algorithms. The counterexamples are designed to be short and human-understandable so that the counterexample generator can be used in the development process \textendash{} a developer could quickly explore variations of an algorithm and investigate where they break down. Our approach is statistical in nature. It runs a candidate algorithm many times and uses statistical tests to try to detect violations of differential privacy. An evaluation on a variety of incorrect published algorithms validates the usefulness of our approach: it correctly rejects incorrect algorithms and provides counterexamples for them within a few seconds.},

  abstract = {Fighting global security threats with only a local view is inherently difficult. Internet network operators need to fight global phenomena such as botnets, but they are hampered by the fact that operators can observe only the traffic in their local domains. We propose a collaborative approach to this problem, in which operators share aggregate information about the traffic in their respective domains through an automated query mechanism. We argue that existing work on differential privacy and type systems can be leveraged to build a programmable query mechanism that can express a wide range of queries while limiting what can be learned about individual customers. We report on our progress towards building such a mechanism, and we discuss opportunities and challenges of the collaborative security approach.},

  abstract = {Differential privacy is a promising approach to privacy preserving data analysis with a well-developed theory for functions. Despite recent work on implementing systems that aim to provide differential privacy, the problem of formally verifying that these systems have differential privacy has not been adequately addressed. We develop a formal probabilistic automaton model of differential privacy for systems by adapting prior work on differential privacy for functions. We present the first sound verification technique for proving differential privacy of interactive systems. The technique is based on a form of probabilistic bisimulation relation. The novelty lies in the way we track quantitative privacy leakage bounds using a relation family instead of a single relation. We illustrate the proof technique on a representative automaton motivated by PINQ, an implemented system that is intended to provide differential privacy. Surprisingly, our analysis yields a privacy leakage bound of (2t {${_\ast}$} ) rather than (t {${_\ast}$} ) when -differentially private functions are called t times. The extra leakage arises from accounting for bounded memory constraints of real computers.},

  isbn = {978-1-4503-2784-8},
  abstract = {Traditional assertions express correctness properties that must hold on every program execution. However, many applications have probabilistic outcomes and consequently their correctness properties are also probabilistic (e.g., they identify faces in images, consume sensor data, or run on unreliable hardware). Traditional assertions do not capture these correctness properties. This paper proposes that programmers express probabilistic correctness properties with probabilistic assertions and describes a new probabilistic evaluation approach to efficiently verify these assertions. Probabilistic assertions are Boolean expressions that express the probability that a property will be true in a given execution rather than asserting that the property must always be true. Given either specific inputs or distributions on the input space, probabilistic evaluation verifies probabilistic assertions by first performing distribution extraction to represent the program as a Bayesian network. Probabilistic evaluation then uses statistical properties to simplify this representation to efficiently compute assertion probabilities directly or with sampling. Our approach is a mix of both static and dynamic analysis: distribution extraction statically builds and optimizes the Bayesian network representation and sampling dynamically interprets this representation. We implement our approach in a tool called Mayhap for C and C++ programs. We evaluate expressiveness, correctness, and performance of Mayhap on programs that use sensors, perform approximate computation, and obfuscate data for privacy. Our case studies demonstrate that probabilistic assertions describe useful correctness properties and that Mayhap efficiently verifies them.},

With dependent types, the type system is powerful enough to verify sophisticated algorithms where the composition theorem falls short. In addition, the inference engine of LightDP infers most of the proof details, and even searches for the proof with minimal privacy cost bound when multiple proofs exist.

Existing differentially private histogram publication schemes have shown that clustering (or grouping) is a promising idea to improve the accuracy of sanitized histograms. However, none of them fully exploits the benefit of clustering. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering framework. It features a sophisticated evaluation of the trade-off between the approximation error due to clustering and the Laplace error due to Laplace noise injected, which is normally overlooked in prior work. In particular, we propose three clustering strategies with different orders of run-time complexities. We prove the superiority of our approach by theoretical utility comparisons with the competitors. Our extensive experiments over various standard real-life and synthetic datasets confirm that our technique consistently outperforms existing competitors.},

  abstract = {Preserving the utility of published datasets while simultaneously providing provable privacy guarantees is a well-known challenge. On the one hand, context-free privacy solutions, such as differential privacy, provide strong privacy guarantees, but often lead to a significant reduction in utility. On the other hand, context-aware privacy solutions, such as information theoretic privacy, achieve an improved privacy-utility tradeoff, but assume that the data holder has access to dataset statistics. We circumvent these limitations by introducing a novel context-aware privacy framework called generative adversarial privacy (GAP). GAP leverages recent advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) to allow the data holder to learn privatization schemes from the dataset itself. Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is formulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that sanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the individuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the private variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we investigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the binary data model, and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models, we derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that the privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion) match the theoretically optimal ones. This demonstrates that our framework can be easily applied in practice, even in the absence of dataset statistics.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has the potential to assist many communities in using the large datasets that are becoming more and more available. Unfortunately, much of that potential is not being realized because it would require sharing data in a way that compromises privacy. In this paper, we investigate a method for ensuring (differential) privacy of the generator of the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. The resulting model can be used for generating synthetic data on which algorithms can be trained and validated, and on which competitions can be conducted, without compromising the privacy of the original dataset. Our method modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs. Our modified framework (which we call PATE-GAN) allows us to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees. We also look at measuring the quality of synthetic data from a new angle; we assert that for the synthetic data to be useful for machine learning researchers, the relative performance of two algorithms (trained and tested) on the synthetic dataset should be the same as their relative performance (when trained and tested) on the original dataset. Our experiments, on various datasets, demonstrate that PATE-GAN consistently outperforms the stateof-the-art method with respect to this and other notions of synthetic data quality.},

  isbn = {978-1-4503-0055-1},
  abstract = {We consider the problem of data mining with formal privacy guarantees, given a data access interface based on the differential privacy framework. Differential privacy requires that computations be insensitive to changes in any particular individual's record, thereby restricting data leaks through the results. The privacy preserving interface ensures unconditionally safe access to the data and does not require from the data miner any expertise in privacy. However, as we show in the paper, a naive utilization of the interface to construct privacy preserving data mining algorithms could lead to inferior data mining results. We address this problem by considering the privacy and the algorithmic requirements simultaneously, focusing on decision tree induction as a sample application. The privacy mechanism has a profound effect on the performance of the methods chosen by the data miner. We demonstrate that this choice could make the difference between an accurate classifier and a completely useless one. Moreover, an improved algorithm can achieve the same level of accuracy and privacy as the naive implementation but with an order of magnitude fewer learning samples.},

Data protection guarantees exist in European Union at a primary law level since 2009, when the Lisbon Treaty has become effective. The new regulation called general data protection regulation adopted on April 27, 2016 will enter into effect on May 25, 2018. Regarding data protection, the US follows a very different approach. The cornerstone of the technical framework of data protection is the concept of differential privacy for which the privacy's provable guarantees hold even against worst-case scenarios when the access to arbitrary auxiliary information is provided. Research directions for integrating legal and technical concepts of privacy are discussed. Although both fields, legal and technical, approach privacy from different perspectives, we expect that these approaches will converge to a common framework. The privacy-preserving framework, therefore, should be a balance between: 1) ambiguous legal concepts and precise mathematical notions of privacy; 2) the desired privacy level; 3) the information loss, which is measured by data utility metrics; and 4) the complexity and the practical feasibility of the proposed technique. Key notions of fairness are incompatible with each other, and hence any privacy-preserving framework should also include the trade-offs between conditions imposed in the definitions of fairness. The complex assembly of legal and technical components implementing various privacy requirements in the privacy-preserving framework, should be realized within the privacy-by-design concept.},

Local differential privacy (LDP), a variant of differential privacy, is recently proposed as a state-of-the-art privacy notion. Unfortunately, achieving LDP on high-dimensional crowdsourced data publication raises great challenges in terms of both computational efficiency and data utility. To this end, based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and Lasso regression, we first propose efficient multi-dimensional joint distribution estimation algorithms with LDP. Then, we develop a local differentially private high-dimensional data publication algorithm (LoPub) by taking advantage of our distribution estimation techniques. In particular, correlations among multiple attributes are identified to reduce the dimensionality of crowdsourced data, thus speeding up the distribution learning process and achieving high data utility. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our multivariate distribution estimation scheme significantly outperforms existing estimation schemes in terms of both communication overhead and estimation speed. Moreover, LoPub can keep, on average, 80\% and 60\% accuracy over the released datasets in terms of support vector machine and random forest classification, respectively.},

This paper presents the first practical approach for differential privacy of SQL queries. Using 8.1 million real-world queries, we conduct an empirical study to determine the requirements for practical differential privacy, and discuss limitations of previous approaches in light of these requirements. To meet these requirements we propose elastic sensitivity, a novel method for approximating the local sensitivity of queries with general equijoins. We prove that elastic sensitivity is an upper bound on local sensitivity and can therefore be used to enforce differential privacy using any local sensitivity-based mechanism.},

Then we privately estimate counts for each bucket, doing so in a manner well-suited for the given query set. Since the performance of the algorithm depends on the input database, we evaluate it on a wide range of real datasets, showing that we can achieve the benefits of data-dependence on both ``easy'' and ``hard'' databases.},

  shorttitle = {When {{Homomorphic Cryptosystem Meets Differential Privacy}}},
  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) classifiers are invaluable building blocks that have been used in many fields. High quality training dataset collected from multiple data providers is essential to train accurate classifiers. However, it raises concern about data privacy due to potential leakage of sensitive information in training dataset. Existing studies have proposed many solutions to privacy-preserving training of ML classifiers, but it remains a challenging task to strike a balance among accuracy, computational efficiency, and security. In this paper, we propose Heda, an efficient privacypreserving scheme for training ML classifiers. By combining homomorphic cryptosystem (HC) with differential privacy (DP), Heda obtains the tradeoffs between efficiency and accuracy, and enables flexible switch among different tradeoffs by parameter tuning. In order to make such combination efficient and feasible, we present novel designs based on both HC and DP: A library of building blocks based on partially HC are proposed to construct complex training algorithms without introducing a trusted thirdparty or computational relaxation; A set of theoretical methods are proposed to determine appropriate privacy budget and to reduce sensitivity. Security analysis demonstrates that our solution can construct complex ML training algorithm securely. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

  volume = {30},
  issn = {1086-3818},
  abstract = {[Governments are under increasing pressure to publicly release collected data in order to promote transparency, accountability, and innovation. Because much of the data they release pertains to individuals, agencies rely on various standards and interventions to protect privacy interests while supporting a range of beneficial uses of the data. However, there are growing concerns among privacy scholars, policymakers, and the public that these approaches are incomplete, inconsistent, and difficult to navigate. To identify gaps in current practice, this Article reviews data released in response to freedom of information and Privacy Act requests, traditional public and vital records, official statistics, and e-government and open government initiatives. It finds that agencies lack formal guidance for implementing privacy interventions in specific cases. Most agencies address privacy by withholding or redacting records that contain directly or indirectly identifying information based on an ad hoc balancing of interests, and different government actors sometimes treat similar privacy risks vastly differently. These observations demonstrate the need for a more systematic approach to privacy analysis and also suggest a new way forward. In response to these concerns, this Article proposes a framework for a modern privacy analysis informed by recent advances in data privacy from disciplines such as computer science, statistics, and law. Modeled on an information security approach, this framework characterizes and distinguishes between privacy controls, threats, vulnerabilities, and utility. When developing a data release mechanism, policymakers should specify the desired data uses and expected benefits, examine each stage of the data lifecycle to identify privacy threats and vulnerabilities, and select controls for each lifecycle stage that are consistent with the uses, threats, and vulnerabilities at that stage. This Article sketches the contours of this analytical framework, populates selected portions of its contents, and illustrates how it can inform the selection of privacy controls by discussing its application to two real-world examples of government data releases.]},

  title = {A {{Learning Theory Approach}} to {{Non}}-{{Interactive Database Privacy}}},
  abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate that, ignoring computational constraints, it is possible to privately release synthetic databases that are useful for large classes of queries -- much larger in size than the database itself. Specifically, we give a mechanism that privately releases synthetic data for a class of queries over a discrete domain with error that grows as a function of the size of the smallest net approximately representing the answers to that class of queries. We show that this in particular implies a mechanism for counting queries that gives error guarantees that grow only with the VC-dimension of the class of queries, which itself grows only logarithmically with the size of the query class. We also show that it is not possible to privately release even simple classes of queries (such as intervals and their generalizations) over continuous domains. Despite this, we give a privacy-preserving polynomial time algorithm that releases information useful for all halfspace queries, given a slight relaxation of the utility guarantee. This algorithm does not release synthetic data, but instead another data structure capable of representing an answer for each query. We also give an efficient algorithm for releasing synthetic data for the class of interval queries and axis-aligned rectangles of constant dimension. Finally, inspired by learning theory, we introduce a new notion of data privacy, which we call distributional privacy, and show that it is strictly stronger than the prevailing privacy notion, differential privacy.},

Our asymptotic results are confirmed by a simulation study.

While smart contracts inherit the availability and other security assurances of blockchains, however, they are impeded by blockchains' lack of confidentiality and poor performance. We present Ekiden, a system that addresses these critical gaps by combining blockchains with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Ekiden leverages a novel architecture that separates consensus from execution, enabling efficient TEE-backed confidentiality-preserving smart-contracts and high scalability. Our prototype (with Tendermint as the consensus layer) achieves example performance of 600x more throughput and 400x less latency at 1000x less cost than the Ethereum mainnet. Another contribution of this paper is that we systematically identify and treat the pitfalls arising from harmonizing TEEs and blockchains. Treated separately, both TEEs and blockchains provide powerful guarantees, but hybridized, though, they engender new attacks. For example, in naive designs, privacy in TEE-backed contracts can be jeopardized by forgery of blocks, a seemingly unrelated attack vector. We believe the insights learned from Ekiden will prove to be of broad importance in hybridized TEE-blockchain systems.},

However, most differential privacy mechanisms assume that the underlying dataset is clean. This paper explores the link between data cleaning and differential privacy in a framework we call PrivateClean. PrivateClean includes a technique for creating private datasets of numerical and discrete-valued attributes, a formalism for privacy-preserving data cleaning, and techniques for answering sum, count, and avg queries after cleaning. We show: (1) how the degree of privacy affects subsequent aggregate query accuracy, (2) how privacy potentially amplifies certain types of errors in a dataset, and (3) how this analysis can be used to tune the degree of privacy. The key insight is to maintain a bipartite graph relating dirty values to clean values and use this graph to estimate biases due to the interaction between cleaning and privacy. We validate these results on four datasets with a variety of well-studied cleaning techniques including using functional dependencies, outlier filtering, and resolving inconsistent attributes.},

  abstract = {Data cleaning, or the process of detecting and repairing inaccurate or corrupt records in the data, is inherently human-driven. State of the art systems assume cleaning experts can access the data (or a sample of it) to tune the cleaning process. However, in many cases, privacy constraints disallow unfettered access to the data. To address this challenge, we observe and provide empirical evidence that data cleaning can be achieved without access to the sensitive data, but with access to a (noisy) query interface that supports a small set of linear counting query primitives. Motivated by this, we present DPClean, a first of a kind system that allows engineers tune data cleaning workflows while ensuring differential privacy. In DPClean, a cleaning engineer can pose sequences of aggregate counting queries with error tolerances. A privacy engine translates each query into a differentially private mechanism that returns an answer with error matching the specified tolerance, and allows the data owner track the overall privacy loss. With extensive experiments using human and simulated cleaning engineers on blocking and matching tasks, we demonstrate that our approach is able to achieve high cleaning quality while ensuring a reasonable privacy loss.},

  abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate that, ignoring computational constraints, it is possible to privately release synthetic databases that are useful for large classes of queries -- much larger in size than the database itself. Specifically, we give a mechanism that privately releases synthetic data for a class of queries over a discrete domain with error that grows as a function of the size of the smallest net approximately representing the answers to that class of queries. We show that this in particular implies a mechanism for counting queries that gives error guarantees that grow only with the VC-dimension of the class of queries, which itself grows only logarithmically with the size of the query class. We also show that it is not possible to privately release even simple classes of queries (such as intervals and their generalizations) over continuous domains. Despite this, we give a privacy-preserving polynomial time algorithm that releases information useful for all halfspace queries, given a slight relaxation of the utility guarantee. This algorithm does not release synthetic data, but instead another data structure capable of representing an answer for each query. We also give an efficient algorithm for releasing synthetic data for the class of interval queries and axis-aligned rectangles of constant dimension. Finally, inspired by learning theory, we introduce a new notion of data privacy, which we call distributional privacy, and show that it is strictly stronger than the prevailing privacy notion, differential privacy.},

Data synthesis (DS) is a statistical disclosure limitation technique for releasing synthetic data sets with pseudo individual records. Traditional DS techniques often rely on strong assumptions of a data intruder's behaviors and background knowledge to assess disclosure risk. Differential privacy (DP) formulates a theoretical approach for a strong and robust privacy guarantee in data release without having to model intruders' behaviors. Efforts have been made aiming to incorporate the DP concept in the DS process. In this paper, we examine current DIfferentially Private Data Synthesis (DIPS) techniques for releasing individual-level surrogate data for the original data, compare the techniques conceptually, and evaluate the statistical utility and inferential properties of the synthetic data via each DIPS technique through extensive simulation studies. Our work sheds light on the practical feasibility and utility of the various DIPS approaches, and suggests future research directions for DIPS.},

The multiplicative weights framework allows us to maintain and improve a distribution approximating a given data set with respect to a set of counting queries. We use the exponential mechanism to select those queries most incorrectly tracked by the current distribution. Combing the two, we quickly approach a distribution that agrees with the data set on the given set of queries up to small error. The resulting algorithm and its analysis is simple, but nevertheless improves upon previous work in terms of both error and running time. We also empirically demonstrate the practicality of our approach on several data sets commonly used in the statistical community for contingency table release.},

In this paper, we propose a new proof technique, called shadow execution, and embed it into a language called ShadowDP. ShadowDP uses shadow execution to generate proofs of differential privacy with very few programmer annotations and without relying on customized logics and verifiers. In addition to verifying Report Noisy Max, we show that it can verify a new variant of Sparse Vector that reports the gap between some noisy query answers and the noisy threshold. Moreover, ShadowDP reduces the complexity of verification: for all of the algorithms we have evaluated, type checking and verification in total takes at most 3 seconds, while prior work takes minutes on the same algorithms.},

  shorttitle = {Passing {{Tests}} without {{Memorizing}}},
  abstract = {We introduce two mathematical frameworks for foolability in the context of generative distribution learning. In a nuthsell, fooling is an algorithmic task in which the input sample is drawn from some target distribution and the goal is to output a synthetic distribution that is indistinguishable from the target w.r.t to some fixed class of tests. This framework received considerable attention in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a recently proposed approach which achieves impressive empirical results. From a theoretical viewpoint this problem seems difficult to model. This is due to the fact that in its basic form, the notion of foolability is susceptible to a type of overfitting called memorizing. This raises a challenge of devising notions and definitions that separate between fooling algorithms that generate new synthetic data vs. algorithms that merely memorize or copy the training set. The first model we consider is called GAM--Foolability and is inspired by GANs. Here the learner has only an indirect access to the target distribution via a discriminator. The second model, called DP--Foolability, exploits the notion of differential privacy as a candidate criterion for non-memorization. We proceed to characterize foolability within these two models and study their interrelations. We show that DP--Foolability implies GAM--Foolability and prove partial results with respect to the converse. It remains, though, an open question whether GAM--Foolability implies DP--Foolability. We also present an application in the context of differentially private PAC learning. We show that from a statistical perspective, for any class H, learnability by a private proper learner is equivalent to the existence of a private sanitizer for H. This can be seen as an analogue of the equivalence between uniform convergence and learnability in classical PAC learning.},

The multiplicative weights framework allows us to maintain and improve a distribution approximating a given data set with respect to a set of counting queries. We use the exponential mechanism to select those queries most incorrectly tracked by the current distribution. Combing the two, we quickly approach a distribution that agrees with the data set on the given set of queries up to small error. The resulting algorithm and its analysis is simple, but nevertheless improves upon previous work in terms of both error and running time.

Since the data may contain sensitive information about individuals, and these analyses can leak that sensitive information, it is important to be able to solve convex minimization in a privacy-preserving way. A series of recent results show how to accurately solve a single convex minimization problem in a differentially private manner. However, the same data is often analyzed repeatedly, and little is known about solving multiple convex minimization problems with differential privacy. For simpler data analyses, such as linear queries, there are remarkable differentially private algorithms such as the private multiplicative weights mechanism (Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS 2010) that accurately answer exponentially many distinct queries. In this work, we extend these results to the case of convex minimization and show how to give accurate and differentially private solutions to *exponentially many* convex minimization problems on a sensitive dataset.},

  abstract = {We consider statistical data analysis in the interactive setting. In this setting a trusted curator maintains a database of sensitive information about individual participants, and releases privacy-preserving answers to queries as they arrive. Our primary contribution is a new differentially private multiplicative weights mechanism for answering a large number of interactive counting (or linear) queries that arrive online and may be adaptively chosen. This is the first mechanism with worst-case accuracy guarantees that can answer large numbers of interactive queries and is efficient (in terms of the runtime's dependence on the data universe size). The error is asymptotically optimal in its dependence on the number of participants, and depends only logarithmically on the number of queries being answered. The running time is nearly linear in the size of the data universe. As a further contribution, when we relax the utility requirement and require accuracy only for databases drawn from a rich class of databases, we obtain exponential improvements in running time. Even in this relaxed setting we continue to guarantee privacy for any input database. Only the utility requirement is relaxed. Specifically, we show that when the input database is drawn from a smooth distribution - a distribution that does not place too much weight on any single data item - accuracy remains as above, and the running time becomes poly-logarithmic in the data universe size. The main technical contributions are the application of multiplicative weights techniques to the differential privacy setting, a new privacy analysis for the interactive setting, and a technique for reducing data dimensionality for databases drawn from smooth distributions.},

We give efficient query release algorithms for this class, in both the interactive and the non-interactive setting. Our algorithms also achieve better accuracy bounds than previous general techniques do when applied to sparse queries: our bounds are independent of the universe size.

  abstract = {As a new way of training generative models, Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) that uses a discriminative model to guide the training of the generative model has enjoyed considerable success in generating real-valued data. However, it has limitations when the goal is for generating sequences of discrete tokens. A major reason lies in that the discrete outputs from the generative model make it difficult to pass the gradient update from the discriminative model to the generative model. Also, the discriminative model can only assess a complete sequence, while for a partially generated sequence, it is non-trivial to balance its current score and the future one once the entire sequence has been generated. In this paper, we propose a sequence generation framework, called SeqGAN, to solve the problems. Modeling the data generator as a stochastic policy in reinforcement learning (RL), SeqGAN bypasses the generator differentiation problem by directly performing gradient policy update. The RL reward signal comes from the GAN discriminator judged on a complete sequence, and is passed back to the intermediate state-action steps using Monte Carlo search. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world tasks demonstrate significant improvements over strong baselines.},

Specifically, we give a mechanism that privately releases synthetic data for a class of queries over a discrete domain with error that grows as a function of the size of the smallest net approximately representing the answers to that class of queries. We show that this in particular implies a mechanism for counting queries that gives error guarantees that grow only with the VC-dimension of the class of queries, which itself grows only logarithmically with the size of the query class. We also show that it is not possible to privately release even simple classes of queries (such as intervals and their generalizations) over continuous domains. Despite this, we give a privacy-preserving polynomial time algorithm that releases information useful for all halfspace queries, given a slight relaxation of the utility guarantee. This algorithm does not release synthetic data, but instead another data structure capable of representing an answer for each query. We also give an efficient algorithm for releasing synthetic data for the class of interval queries and axis-aligned rectangles of constant dimension. Finally, inspired by learning theory, we introduce a new notion of data privacy, which we call distributional privacy, and show that it is strictly stronger than the prevailing privacy notion, differential privacy.},

  abstract = {A central problem in differentially private data analysis is how to design efficient algorithms capable of answering large numbers of counting queries on a sensitive database. Counting queries of the form "What fraction of individual records in the database satisfy the property q?" We prove that if one-way functions exist, then there is no algorithm that takes as input a database D in (\{0,1\}\^d)\^n, and k = n\^\{2+o(1)\} arbitrary efficiently computable counting queries, runs in time poly(d, n), and returns an approximate answer to each query, while satisfying differential privacy. We also consider the complexity of answering "simple" counting queries, and make some progress in this direction by showing that the above result holds even when we require that the queries are computable by constant depth (AC-0) circuits. Our result is almost tight in the sense that nearly n\^2 counting queries can be answered efficiently while satisfying differential privacy. Moreover, super-polynomially many queries can be answered in exponential time. We prove our results by extending the connection between differentially private counting query release and cryptographic traitor-tracing schemes to the setting where the queries are given to the sanitizer as input, and by constructing a traitor-tracing scheme that is secure in this setting.},

  abstract = {Various paradigms, based on differential privacy, have been proposed to release a privacy-preserving dataset with statistical approximation. Nonetheless, most existing schemes are limited when facing highly correlated attributes, and cannot prevent privacy threats from untrusted servers. In this paper, we propose a novel Copula- based scheme to efficiently synthesize and release multi-dimensional crowdsourced data with local differential privacy. In our scheme, each participant's (or user's) data is locally transformed into bit strings based on a randomized response technique, which guarantees a participant's privacy on the participant (user) side. Then, Copula theory is leveraged to synthesize multi-dimensional crowdsourced data based on univariate marginal distribution and attribute dependence. Univariate marginal distribution is estimated by the Lasso-based regression algorithm from the aggregated privacy- preserving bit strings. Dependencies among attributes are modeled as multivariate Gaussian Copula, of which parameter is estimated by Pearson correlation coefficients. We conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our scheme. Our experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is effective for the release of multi-dimensional data with local differential privacy guaranteed to distributed participants.},

  title = {High-{{Dimensional Crowdsourced Data Distribution Estimation}} with {{Local Privacy}}},
  abstract = {High-dimensional crowdsourced data collected from a large number of users may produc3 rich knowledge for our society but also bring unprecedented privacy threats to participants. Recently differential privacy has been proposed as an effective means to mitigate privacy concerns. However, existing work on differential privacy suffers from the "curse of high-dimensionality" (data with multiple attributes) and high scalability (data with large scale records). Moreover, traditional methods of differential privacy were achieved via aggregation results, which cannot guarantee local privacy for distributed users in crowdsourced systems. To deal with these issues, in this paper we propose a novel scheme that can efficiently estimate multivariate joint distribution for high-dimensional data with local privacy. On the client side, we employ randomized response techniques to locally transform data from distributed users into privacy-preserving bit strings, which can prevent potential inside privacy attacks in crowdsourced systems. On the server side, the crowdsourced bit strings are aggregated for multivariate distribution estimation. Specifically, we first propose a multivariate version of the expectation maximization (EM) based algorithm to estimate the joint distribution of high dimensional data. To speed up the performance, unlike the EM-based method that needs to scan each user's bit string, we propose to use Lasso regression to obtain the distribution estimation from the aggregation information only once, which can significantly reduce the computation time for multivariate distribution estimation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our multivariate distribution estimation scheme over existing estimation schemes.},

  abstract = {Organizations with a large user base, such as Samsung and Google, can potentially benefit from collecting and mining users' data. However, doing so raises privacy concerns, and risks accidental privacy breaches with serious consequences. Local differential privacy (LDP) techniques address this problem by only collecting randomized answers from each user, with guarantees of plausible deniability; meanwhile, the aggregator can still build accurate models and predictors by analyzing large amounts of such randomized data. So far, existing LDP solutions either have severely restricted functionality, or focus mainly on theoretical aspects such as asymptotical bounds rather than practical usability and performance. Motivated by this, we propose Harmony, a practical, accurate and efficient system for collecting and analyzing data from smart device users, while satisfying LDP. Harmony applies to multi-dimensional data containing both numerical and categorical attributes, and supports both basic statistics (e.g., mean and frequency estimates), and complex machine learning tasks (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression and SVM classification). Experiments using real data confirm Harmony's effectiveness.},

Given a base synopsis generator that takes a distribution on Q and produces a ``weak'' synopsis that yields ``good'' answers for a majority of the weight in Q, our Boosting for Queries algorithm obtains a synopsis that is good for all of Q. We ensure privacy for the rows of the database, but the boosting is performed on the queries. We also provide the first synopsis generators for arbitrary sets of arbitrary lowsensitivity queries, i.e., queries whose answers do not vary much under the addition or deletion of a single row.},

For learning with smooth generalized linear losses, we propose an approximate stochastic gradient oracle estimated from non-interactive LDP channel using Chebyshev expansion, which is combined with inexact gradient methods to obtain an efficient algorithm with quasi-polynomial sample complexity bound. For the high-dimensional world, we discover that under 2-norm assumption on data points, high-dimensional sparse linear regression and mean estimation can be achieved with logarithmic dependence on dimension, using random projection and approximate recovery. We also extend our methods to Kernel Ridge Regression. Our work is the first one that makes learning and estimation possible for a broad range of learning tasks under noninteractive LDP model.},

  shorttitle = {Distributed Deep Learning on Edge-Devices},
  abstract = {A large portion of data mining and analytic services use modern machine learning techniques, such as deep learning. The state-of-the-art results by deep learning come at the price of an intensive use of computing resources. The leading frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) are executed on GPUs or on high-end servers in datacenters. On the other end, there is a proliferation of personal devices with possibly free CPU cycles; this can enable services to run in users' homes, embedding machine learning operations. In this paper, we ask the following question: Is distributed deep learning computation on WAN connected devices feasible, in spite of the traffic caused by learning tasks? We show that such a setup rises some important challenges, most notably the ingress traffic that the servers hosting the up-to-date model have to sustain. In order to reduce this stress, we propose adaComp, a novel algorithm for compressing worker updates to the model on the server. Applicable to stochastic gradient descent based approaches, it combines efficient gradient selection and learning rate modulation. We then experiment and measure the impact of compression, device heterogeneity and reliability on the accuracy of learned models, with an emulator platform that embeds TensorFlow into Linux containers. We report a reduction of the total amount of data sent by workers to the server by two order of magnitude (e.g., 191-fold reduction for a convolutional network on the MNIST dataset), when compared to a standard asynchronous stochastic gradient descent, while preserving model accuracy.},

  title = {Differentially {{Private Data Aggregation}} with {{Optimal Utility}}},
  abstract = {Computing aggregate statistics about user data is of vital importance for a variety of services and systems, but this practice has been shown to seriously undermine the privacy of users. Differential privacy has proved to be an effective tool to sanitize queries over a database, and various cryptographic protocols have been recently proposed to enforce differential privacy in a distributed setting, e.g., statical queries on sensitive data stored on the user's side. The widespread deployment of differential privacy techniques in real-life settings is, however, undermined by several limitations that existing constructions suffer from: they support only a limited class of queries, they pose a trade-off between privacy and utility of the query result, they are affected by the answer pollution problem, or they are inefficient. This paper presents PrivaDA, a novel design architecture for distributed differential privacy that leverages recent advances in SMPCs on fixed and floating point arithmetics to overcome the previously mentioned limitations. In particular, PrivaDA supports a variety of perturbation mechanisms (e.g., the Laplace, discrete Laplace, and exponential mechanisms) and it constitutes the first generic technique to generate noise in a fully distributed manner while maintaining the optimal utility. Furthermore, PrivaDA does not suffer from the answer pollution problem. We demonstrate the efficiency of PrivaDA with a performance evaluation, and its expressiveness and flexibility by illustrating a variety of application scenarios such as privacy-preserving web analytics.},

This distribution has the essential property that it can be smoothly annealed into a categorical distribution.

In this paper, we propose a new approach, medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN), to generate realistic synthetic patient records. Based on input real patient records, medGAN can generate high-dimensional discrete variables (e.g., binary and count features) via a combination of an autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and shortcut connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN generates synthetic patient records that achieve comparable performance to real data on many experiments including distribution statistics, predictive modeling tasks and a medical expert review. We also empirically observe a limited privacy risk in both identity and attribute disclosure using medGAN.},

In particular, we formulate a generic IDC framework based on the Mirror Descent algorithm, a popular convex optimization algorithm [1]. We then present two concrete applications, namely, cut queries over a bipartite graph and linear queries over lowrank matrices, and provide significantly tighter error bounds than the ones by [15,13].},

  abstract = {We study the problem of answering \textbackslash{}emph\{\$k\$-way marginal\} queries on a database \$D \textbackslash{}in (\textbackslash\{0,1\textbackslash\}\^d)\^n\$, while preserving differential privacy. The answer to a \$k\$-way marginal query is the fraction of the database's records \$x \textbackslash{}in \textbackslash\{0,1\textbackslash\}\^d\$ with a given value in each of a given set of up to \$k\$ columns. Marginal queries enable a rich class of statistical analyses on a dataset, and designing efficient algorithms for privately answering marginal queries has been identified as an important open problem in private data analysis. For any \$k\$, we give a differentially private online algorithm that runs in time \$\$ \textbackslash{}min\{\textbackslash{}exp(d\^\{1-\textbackslash{}Omega(1/\textbackslash{}sqrt\{k\})\}), \textbackslash{}exp(d / \textbackslash{}log\^\{.99\} d)\textbackslash\} \$\$ per query and answers any (possibly superpolynomially long and adaptively chosen) sequence of \$k\$-way marginal queries up to error at most \$\textbackslash{}pm .01\$ on every query, provided \$n \textbackslash{}gtrsim d\^\{.51\} \$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm capable of privately answering marginal queries with a non-trivial worst-case accuracy guarantee on a database of size \$\textbackslash{}poly(d, k)\$ in time \$\textbackslash{}exp(o(d))\$. Our algorithms are a variant of the private multiplicative weights algorithm (Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS '10), but using a different low-weight representation of the database. We derive our low-weight representation using approximations to the OR function by low-degree polynomials with coefficients of bounded \$L\_1\$-norm. We also prove a strong limitation on our approach that is of independent approximation-theoretic interest. Specifically, we show that for any \$k = o(\textbackslash{}log d)\$, any polynomial with coefficients of \$L\_1\$-norm \$poly(d)\$ that pointwise approximates the \$d\$-variate OR function on all inputs of Hamming weight at most \$k\$ must have degree \$d\^\{1-O(1/\textbackslash{}sqrt\{k\})\}\$.},

  abstract = {Dynamically typed languages such as JavaScript and Python are increasingly popular, yet static typing has not been totally eclipsed: Python now supports type annotations and languages like TypeScript offer a middle-ground for JavaScript: a strict superset of JavaScript, to which it transpiles, coupled with a type system that permits partially typed programs. However, static typing has a cost: adding annotations, reading the added syntax, and wrestling with the type system to fix type errors. Type inference can ease the transition to more statically typed code and unlock the benefits of richer compile-time information, but is limited in languages like JavaScript as it cannot soundly handle duck-typing or runtime evaluation via eval. We propose DeepTyper, a deep learning model that understands which types naturally occur in certain contexts and relations and can provide type suggestions, which can often be verified by the type checker, even if it could not infer the type initially. DeepTyper, leverages an automatically aligned corpus of tokens and types to accurately predict thousands of variable and function type annotations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that context is key in accurately assigning these types and introduce a technique to reduce overfitting on local cues while highlighting the need for further improvements. Finally, we show that our model can interact with a compiler to provide more than 4,000 additional type annotations with over 95\% precision that could not be inferred without the aid of DeepTyper.},

  abstract = {Typical personal medical data contains sensitive information about individuals. Storing or sharing the personal medical data is thus often risky. For example, a short DNA sequence can provide information that can not only identify an individual, but also his or her relatives. Nonetheless, most countries and researchers agree on the necessity of collecting personal medical data. This stems from the fact that medical data, including genomic data, are an indispensable resource for further research and development regarding disease prevention and treatment. To prevent personal medical data from being misused, techniques to reliably preserve sensitive information should be developed for real world application. In this paper, we propose a framework called anonymized generative adversarial networks (AnomiGAN), to improve the maintenance of privacy of personal medical data, while also maintaining high prediction performance. We compared our method to state-of-the-art techniques and observed that our method preserves the same level of privacy as differential privacy (DP), but had better prediction results. We also observed that there is a trade-off between privacy and performance results depending on the degree of preservation of the original data. Here, we provide a mathematical overview of our proposed model and demonstrate its validation using UCI machine learning repository datasets in order to highlight its utility in practice. Experimentally, our approach delivers a better performance compared to that of the DP approach.},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAE), the literature on generative modelling has witnessed an overwhelming resurgence. The impressive, yet elusive empirical performance of GANs has lead to the rise of many GAN-VAE hybrids, with the hopes of GAN level performance and additional benefits of VAE, such as an encoder for feature reduction, which is not offered by GANs. Recently, the Wasserstein Autoencoder (WAE) was proposed, achieving performance similar to that of GANs, yet it is still unclear whether the two are fundamentally different or can be further improved into a unified model. In this work, we study the f -GAN and WAE models and make two main discoveries. First, we find that the f -GAN and WAE objectives partake in a primal-dual relationship and are equivalent under some assumptions, which then allows us to explicate the success of WAE. Second, the equivalence result allows us to, for the first time, prove generalization bounds for Autoencoder models, which is a pertinent problem when it comes to theoretical analyses of generative models. Furthermore, we show that the WAE objective is related to other statistical quantities such as the f -divergence and in particular, upper bounded by the Wasserstein distance, which then allows us to tap into existing efficient (regularized) optimal transport solvers. Our findings thus present the first primal-dual relationship between GANs and Autoencoder models, comment on generalization abilities and make a step towards unifying these models.},

  title = {Learning in {{Implicit Generative Models}}},
  abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an algorithmic framework for constructing generative models with several appealing properties: they do not require a likelihood function to be specified, only a generating procedure; they provide samples that are sharp and compelling; and they allow us to harness our knowledge of building highly accurate neural network classifiers. Here, we develop our understanding of GANs with the aim of forming a rich view of this growing area of machine learning\textemdash{}to build connections to the diverse set of statistical thinking on this topic, of which much can be gained by a mutual exchange of ideas. We frame GANs within the wider landscape of algorithms for learning in implicit generative models\textemdash{}models that only specify a stochastic procedure with which to generate data\textemdash{}and relate these ideas to modelling problems in related fields, such as econometrics and approximate Bayesian computation. We develop likelihood-free inference methods and highlight hypothesis testing as a principle for learning in implicit generative models, using which we are able to derive the objective function used by GANs, and many other related objectives. The testing viewpoint directs our focus to the general problem of density-ratio and density-difference estimation. There are four approaches for density comparison, one of which is a solution using classifiers to distinguish real from generated data. Other approaches such as divergence minimisation and moment matching have also been explored, and we synthesise these views to form an understanding in terms of the relationships between them and the wider literature, highlighting avenues for future exploration and cross-pollination.},

  abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of approximately releasing the cut function of a graph while preserving differential privacy, and give new algorithms (and new analyses of existing algorithms) in both the interactive and non-interactive settings. Our algorithms in the interactive setting are achieved by revisiting the problem of releasing differentially private, approximate answers to a large number of queries on a database. We show that several algorithms for this problem fall into the same basic framework, and are based on the existence of objects which we call iterative database construction algorithms. We give a new generic framework in which new (efficient) IDC algorithms give rise to new (efficient) interactive private query release mechanisms. Our modular analysis simplifies and tightens the analysis of previous algorithms, leading to improved bounds. We then give a new IDC algorithm (and therefore a new private, interactive query release mechanism) based on the Frieze/Kannan low-rank matrix decomposition. This new release mechanism gives an improvement on prior work in a range of parameters where the size of the database is comparable to the size of the data universe (such as releasing all cut queries on dense graphs). We also give a non-interactive algorithm for efficiently releasing private synthetic data for graph cuts with error O(|V|\^\{1.5\}). Our algorithm is based on randomized response and a non-private implementation of the SDP-based, constant-factor approximation algorithm for cut-norm due to Alon and Naor. Finally, we give a reduction based on the IDC framework showing that an efficient, private algorithm for computing sufficiently accurate rank-1 matrix approximations would lead to an improved efficient algorithm for releasing private synthetic data for graph cuts. We leave finding such an algorithm as our main open problem.},

We frame learning as an optimization minimizing a two-sample test statistic---informally speaking, a good generator network produces samples that cause a two-sample test to fail to reject the null hypothesis. As our two-sample test statistic, we use an unbiased estimate of the maximum mean discrepancy, which is the centerpiece of the nonparametric kernel two-sample test proposed by Gretton et al. (2012). We compare to the adversarial nets framework introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), in which learning is a two-player game between a generator network and an adversarial discriminator network, both trained to outwit the other. From this perspective, the MMD statistic plays the role of the discriminator. In addition to empirical comparisons, we prove bounds on the generalization error incurred by optimizing the empirical MMD.},

We investigate how to obtain a good statistical guarantee for GANs through the lens of regularization. We discover and isolate a new notion of regularization, called the \textbackslash{}textit\{generator/discriminator pair regularization\}, that sheds light on the advantage of GANs compared to classical parametric and nonparametric approaches for density estimation.

  shorttitle = {Passing {{Tests}} without {{Memorizing}}},
  abstract = {We introduce two mathematical frameworks for foolability in the context of generative distribution learning. In a nuthsell, fooling is an algorithmic task in which the input sample is drawn from some target distribution and the goal is to output a synthetic distribution that is indistinguishable from the target w.r.t to some fixed class of tests. This framework received considerable attention in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a recently proposed approach which achieves impressive empirical results. From a theoretical viewpoint this problem seems difficult to model. This is due to the fact that in its basic form, the notion of foolability is susceptible to a type of overfitting called memorizing. This raises a challenge of devising notions and definitions that separate between fooling algorithms that generate new synthetic data vs. algorithms that merely memorize or copy the training set. The first model we consider is called GAM--Foolability and is inspired by GANs. Here the learner has only an indirect access to the target distribution via a discriminator. The second model, called DP--Foolability, exploits the notion of differential privacy as a candidate criterion for non-memorization. We proceed to characterize foolability within these two models and study their interrelations. We show that DP--Foolability implies GAM--Foolability and prove partial results with respect to the converse. It remains, though, an open question whether GAM--Foolability implies DP--Foolability. We also present an application in the context of differentially private PAC learning. We show that from a statistical perspective, for any class H, learnability by a private proper learner is equivalent to the existence of a private sanitizer for H. This can be seen as an analogue of the equivalence between uniform convergence and learnability in classical PAC learning.},

Motivated by our previous work ADASYN [1], this paper presents a novel kernel based adaptive synthetic over-sampling approach, named KernelADASYN, for imbalanced data classification problems. The idea is to construct an adaptive over-sampling distribution to generate synthetic minority class data. The adaptive over-sampling distribution is first estimated with kernel density estimation methods and is further weighted by the difficulty level for different minority class data. The classification performance of our proposed adaptive over-sampling approach is evaluated on several real-life benchmarks, specifically on medical and healthcare applications. The experimental results show the competitive classification performance for many real-life imbalanced data classification problems.},

  which are Sturm\textendash{}Liouville differential equations. It is a general feature of such differential equations that there is a distinguished orthonormal set of solutions.
The Chebyshev polynomials Tn are polynomials with the largest possible leading coefficient whose absolute value on the interval [-1,1] is bounded by 1.  They are also the extremal polynomials for many other properties. Chebyshev polynomials are important in approximation theory because the roots of Tn(x), which are also called Chebyshev nodes, are used as nodes in polynomial interpolation. The resulting interpolation polynomial minimizes the problem of Runge's phenomenon and provides an approximation that is close to the polynomial of best approximation to a continuous function under the maximum norm. This approximation leads directly to the method of Clenshaw\textendash{}Curtis quadrature. 

These polynomials were named after Pafnuty Chebyshev,. The letter T is used because of the alternative transliterations of the name Chebyshev as Tchebycheff, Tchebyshev (French) or Tschebyschow (German).},

  abstract = {The maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is a recently proposed test statistic for two-sample test. Its quadratic time complexity, however, greatly hampers its availability to large-scale applications. To accelerate the MMD calculation, in this study we propose an efficient method called FastMMD. The core idea of FastMMD is to equivalently transform the MMD with shiftinvariant kernels into the amplitude expectation of a linear combination of sinusoid components based on Bochner's theorem and Fourier transform (Rahimi \& Recht, 2007). Taking advantage of sampling of Fourier transform, FastMMD decreases the time complexity for MMD calculation from O(N 2d) to O(N d), where N and d are the size and dimension of the sample set, respectively. For kernels that are spherically invariant, the computation can be further accelerated to O(N log d) by using the Fastfood technique (Le et al., 2013). The uniform convergence of our method has also been theoretically proved in both unbiased and biased estimates. We have further provided a geometric explanation for our method, namely ensemble of circular discrepancy, which facilitates us to understand the insight of MMD, and is hopeful to help arouse more extensive metrics for assessing two-sample test. Experimental results substantiate that FastMMD is with similar accuracy as exact MMD, while with faster computation speed and lower variance than the existing MMD approximation methods.},

  abstract = {Suppose we would like to know all answers to a set of statistical queries C on a data set up to small error, but we can only access the data itself using statistical queries. A trivial solution is to exhaustively ask all queries in C. Can we do any better? + We show that the number of statistical queries necessary and sufficient for this task is---up to polynomial factors---equal to the agnostic learning complexity of C in Kearns' statistical query (SQ) model. This gives a complete answer to the question when running time is not a concern. + We then show that the problem can be solved efficiently (allowing arbitrary error on a small fraction of queries) whenever the answers to C can be described by a submodular function. This includes many natural concept classes, such as graph cuts and Boolean disjunctions and conjunctions. While interesting from a learning theoretic point of view, our main applications are in privacy-preserving data analysis: Here, our second result leads to the first algorithm that efficiently releases differentially private answers to of all Boolean conjunctions with 1\% average error. This presents significant progress on a key open problem in privacy-preserving data analysis. Our first result on the other hand gives unconditional lower bounds on any differentially private algorithm that admits a (potentially non-privacy-preserving) implementation using only statistical queries. Not only our algorithms, but also most known private algorithms can be implemented using only statistical queries, and hence are constrained by these lower bounds. Our result therefore isolates the complexity of agnostic learning in the SQ-model as a new barrier in the design of differentially private algorithms.},

  abstract = {Generative adversarial training can be generally understood as minimizing certain moment matching loss defined by a set of discriminator functions, typically neural networks. The discriminator set should be large enough to be able to uniquely identify the true distribution (discriminative), and also be small enough to go beyond memorizing samples (generalizable). In this paper, we show that a discriminator set is guaranteed to be discriminative whenever its linear span is dense in the set of bounded continuous functions. This is a very mild condition satisfied even by neural networks with a single neuron. Further, we develop generalization bounds between the learned distribution and true distribution under different evaluation metrics. When evaluated with neural distance, our bounds show that generalization is guaranteed as long as the discriminator set is small enough, regardless of the size of the generator or hypothesis set. When evaluated with KL divergence, our bound provides an explanation on the counter-intuitive behaviors of testing likelihood in GAN training. Our analysis sheds lights on understanding the practical performance of GANs.},

  abstract = {We develop theory for using heuristics to solve computationally hard problems in differential privacy. Heuristic approaches have enjoyed tremendous success in machine learning, for which performance can be empirically evaluated. However, privacy guarantees cannot be evaluated empirically, and must be proven --- without making heuristic assumptions. We show that learning problems over broad classes of functions can be solved privately and efficiently, assuming the existence of a non-private oracle for solving the same problem. Our first algorithm yields a privacy guarantee that is contingent on the correctness of the oracle. We then give a reduction which applies to a class of heuristics which we call certifiable, which allows us to convert oracle-dependent privacy guarantees to worst-case privacy guarantee that hold even when the heuristic standing in for the oracle might fail in adversarial ways. Finally, we consider a broad class of functions that includes most classes of simple boolean functions studied in the PAC learning literature, including conjunctions, disjunctions, parities, and discrete halfspaces. We show that there is an efficient algorithm for privately constructing synthetic data for any such class, given a non-private learning oracle. This in particular gives the first oracle-efficient algorithm for privately generating synthetic data for contingency tables. The most intriguing question left open by our work is whether or not every problem that can be solved differentially privately can be privately solved with an oracle-efficient algorithm. While we do not resolve this, we give a barrier result that suggests that any generic oracle-efficient reduction must fall outside of a natural class of algorithms (which includes the algorithms given in this paper).},

  abstract = {We study the connection between the highly non-convex loss function of a simple model of the fully-connected feed-forward neural network and the Hamiltonian of the spherical spin-glass model under the assumptions of: i) variable independence, ii) redundancy in network parametrization, and iii) uniformity. These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.},

On the theory side, we show that our method provably converges to an equilibrium for semi-shallow GAN architectures, i.e. architectures where the discriminator is a one layer network and the generator is arbitrary. On the practical side, we develop an efficient heuristic guided by our theoretical results, which we apply to commonly used deep GAN architectures.

We show that even though GAN optimization does not correspond to a convex-concave game (even for simple parameterizations), under proper conditions, equilibrium points of this optimization procedure are still \textbackslash{}emph\{locally asymptotically stable\} for the traditional GAN formulation. On the other hand, we show that the recently proposed Wasserstein GAN can have non-convergent limit cycles near equilibrium.

Such LNEs, however, can be arbitrarily far from an actual Nash equilibrium (NE), which implies that there are no guarantees on the quality of the found generator or classifier. This paper proposes to model GANs explicitly as finite games in mixed strategies, thereby ensuring that every LNE is an NE. With this formulation, we propose a solution method that is proven to monotonically converge to a resource-bounded Nash equilibrium (RB-NE): by increasing computational resources we can find better solutions. We empirically demonstrate that our method is less prone to typical GAN problems such as mode collapse, and produces solutions that are less exploitable than those produced by GANs and MGANs, and closely resemble theoretical predictions about NEs.},

  abstract = {Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a minimax game between a generator mimicking the true model and a discriminator distinguishing the samples produced by the generator from the real training samples. Given an unconstrained discriminator able to approximate any function, this game reduces to finding the generative model minimizing a divergence measure, e.g. the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence, to the data distribution. However, in practice the discriminator is constrained to be in a smaller class \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ such as neural nets. Then, a natural question is how the divergence minimization interpretation changes as we constrain \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$. In this work, we address this question by developing a convex duality framework for analyzing GANs. For a convex set \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$, this duality framework interprets the original GAN formulation as finding the generative model with minimum JS-divergence to the distributions penalized to match the moments of the data distribution, with the moments specified by the discriminators in \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$. We show that this interpretation more generally holds for f-GAN and Wasserstein GAN. As a byproduct, we apply the duality framework to a hybrid of f-divergence and Wasserstein distance. Unlike the f-divergence, we prove that the proposed hybrid divergence changes continuously with the generative model, which suggests regularizing the discriminator's Lipschitz constant in f-GAN and vanilla GAN. We numerically evaluate the power of the suggested regularization schemes for improving GAN's training performance.},

  title = {Approximation and {{Convergence Properties}} of {{Generative Adversarial Learning}}},
  abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GAN) approximate a target data distribution by jointly optimizing an objective function through a "two-player game" between a generator and a discriminator. Despite their empirical success, however, two very basic questions on how well they can approximate the target distribution remain unanswered. First, it is not known how restricting the discriminator family affects the approximation quality. Second, while a number of different objective functions have been proposed, we do not understand when convergence to the global minima of the objective function leads to convergence to the target distribution under various notions of distributional convergence. In this paper, we address these questions in a broad and unified setting by defining a notion of adversarial divergences that includes a number of recently proposed objective functions. We show that if the objective function is an adversarial divergence with some additional conditions, then using a restricted discriminator family has a moment-matching effect. Additionally, we show that for objective functions that are strict adversarial divergences, convergence in the objective function implies weak convergence, thus generalizing previous results.},

  abstract = {Privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms are crucial for the increasingly common setting in which personal data, such as medical or financial records, are analyzed. We provide general techniques to produce privacy-preserving approximations of classifiers learned via (regularized) empirical risk minimization (ERM). These algorithms are private under the {$\epsilon$}-differential privacy definition due to Dwork et al. (2006). First we apply the output perturbation ideas of Dwork et al. (2006), to ERM classification. Then we propose a new method, objective perturbation, for privacy-preserving machine learning algorithm design. This method entails perturbing the objective function before optimizing over classifiers. If the loss and regularizer satisfy certain convexity and differentiability criteria, we prove theoretical results showing that our algorithms preserve privacy, and provide generalization bounds for linear and nonlinear kernels. We further present a privacypreserving technique for tuning the parameters in general machine learning algorithms, thereby providing end-to-end privacy guarantees for the training process. We apply these results to produce privacy-preserving analogues of regularized logistic regression and support vector machines. We obtain encouraging results from evaluating their performance on real demographic and benchmark data sets. Our results show that both theoretically and empirically, objective perturbation is superior to the previous state-of-the-art, output perturbation, in managing the inherent tradeoff between privacy and learning performance.},

The analysis of this algorithm yields a simple proof of von Neumann's famous minmax theorem, as well as a provable method of approximately solving a game. We then show that the on-line prediction model is obtained by applying this gameplaying algorithm to an appropriate choice of game and that boosting is obtained by applying the same algorithm to the ``dual'' of this game.},

  abstract = {Save for some special cases, current training methods for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are at best guaranteed to converge to a `local Nash equilibrium` (LNE). Such LNEs, however, can be arbitrarily far from an actual Nash equilibrium (NE), which implies that there are no guarantees on the quality of the found generator or classifier. This paper proposes to model GANs explicitly as finite games in mixed strategies, thereby ensuring that every LNE is an NE. With this formulation, we propose a solution method that is proven to monotonically converge to a resource-bounded Nash equilibrium (RB-NE): by increasing computational resources we can find better solutions. We empirically demonstrate that our method is less prone to typical GAN problems such as mode collapse, and produces solutions that are less exploitable than those produced by GANs and MGANs, and closely resemble theoretical predictions about NEs.},

Inspired by the fictitious play learning process, a novel training method, referred to as Fictitious GAN, is introduced. Fictitious GAN trains the deep neural networks using a mixture of historical models. Specifically, the discriminator (resp. generator) is updated according to the best-response to the mixture outputs from a sequence of previously trained generators (resp. discriminators). It is shown that Fictitious GAN can effectively resolve some convergence issues that cannot be resolved by the standard training approach. It is proved that asymptotically the average of the generator outputs has the same distribution as the data samples.},

However, they are notoriously hard to train and can suffer from the problem of missing modes where the model is not able to produce examples in certain regions of the space. We propose an iterative procedure, called AdaGAN, where at every step we add a new component into a mixture model by running a GAN algorithm on a reweighted sample. This is inspired by boosting algorithms, where many potentially weak individual predictors are greedily aggregated to form a strong composite predictor. We prove that such an incremental procedure leads to convergence to the true distribution in a finite number of steps if each step is optimal, and convergence at an exponential rate otherwise. We also illustrate experimentally that this procedure addresses the problem of missing modes.},

This geometric intuition reveals the limitations of the existing approaches and leads us to propose a new formulation called geometric GAN using SVM separating hyperplane that maximizes the margin. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometric GAN converges to a Nash equilibrium between the discriminator and generator.

  abstract = {Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants have recently attracted intensive research interests due to their elegant theoretical foundation and excellent empirical performance as generative models. These tools provide a promising direction in the studies where data availability is limited. One common issue in GANs is that the density of the learned generative distribution could concentrate on the training data points, meaning that they can easily remember training samples due to the high model complexity of deep networks. This becomes a major concern when GANs are applied to private or sensitive data such as patient medical records, and the concentration of distribution may divulge critical patient information. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a differentially private GAN (DPGAN) model, in which we achieve differential privacy in GANs by adding carefully designed noise to gradients during the learning procedure. We provide rigorous proof for the privacy guarantee, as well as comprehensive empirical evidence to support our analysis, where we demonstrate that our method can generate high quality data points at a reasonable privacy level.},

Other learning algorithms, such as AdaBoost and hard-SVM, aim at minimizing the maximal loss over the training set. The average loss is more popular, particularly in deep learning, due to three main reasons. First, it can be conveniently minimized using online algorithms, that process few examples at each iteration. Second, it is often argued that there is no sense to minimize the loss on the training set too much, as it will not be reflected in the generalization loss. Last, the maximal loss is not robust to outliers. In this paper we describe and analyze an algorithm that can convert any online algorithm to a minimizer of the maximal loss. We prove that in some situations better accuracy on the training set is crucial to obtain good performance on unseen examples. Last, we propose robust versions of the approach that can handle outliers.},

We also study the implications of our results to learning in repeated zero-sum games, in a setting where the players have access to oracles that compute, in constant time, their best-response to any mixed strategy of their opponent.

We propose a simple algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a smoothed version of \$f\$ that is guaranteed to achieve our goal as long as \$\textbackslash{}nu \textbackslash{}le O(\textbackslash{}epsilon\^\{1.5\}/d)\$. We also provide an almost matching lower bound showing that our algorithm achieves optimal error tolerance \$\textbackslash{}nu\$ among all algorithms making a polynomial number of queries of \$f\$. As a concrete example, we show that our results can be directly used to give sample complexities for learning a ReLU unit.},
