- Can we use this result on the left in place of the separator set
  - Learning in Non-convex games with optimization oracle
  - Can we use this bound to improve the Heuristics paper 
    - How can they relate 
  - Can we connect this to objective perturbation as a technique
    - They require convex losses -- can we make this lipschitz
    - Look at "efficient private erms for smooth objectives" , "non-convex erm papers"
- Can we make a small neural netowork (of dimension $\log|Q|$)
  - A single layer neural network with thresholding can represent all k-way marginals -- use this with chekhov gan 
  - It's not necessarily clear how "non-convex game paper" relates to GANs -- the non-convex uses a specific algorithm to train
- Relate mixture of discriminators to
